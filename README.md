# User Defined Functions

This repository brings together a set of user-defined functions (UDFs) developed for VBA and Power Query (M), with the goal of extending the native capabilities of Excel and Power BI.
Here you will find both functions created by me and useful functions developed by others — always properly organized, documented, and referenced.

## 🎯 Objective

- To centralize, organize, and facilitate access to a catalog of reusable functions
- To accelerate the development of solutions in Excel, Power Query, and Power BI.
- To maintain a versioned and easily searchable repository.
- To reuse functions tested and validated in different contexts.

## 📖 Documentation

- This repo's documentation is hosted on this [GitHub Wiki](wiki)

## 🤝 Contributions
