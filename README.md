# User-Defined Functions

This repository brings together a set of user-defined functions (UDFs) developed for [VBA](../../wiki/VBA) and [Power Query (M Code)](../../wiki/Power-Query-(M-Code)), with the goal of extending the native capabilities of Excel and Power BI.
Here you will find both functions created by me and useful functions developed by others — always properly organized, documented, and referenced.

## 🎯 Objective

- To centralize, organize, and facilitate access to a catalog of reusable functions
- To accelerate the development of solutions in Excel, Power Query, and Power BI.
- To maintain a versioned and easily searchable repository.
- To reuse functions tested and validated in different contexts.

## 📖 Documentation

- This repo's documentation is hosted on this [GitHub Wiki](../../wiki)
